# K-Means Clustering Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Means Clustering algorithm** from scratch as well as using libraries like scikit-learn. K-Means is one of the most widely used **unsupervised learning algorithms** for clustering, partitioning data into groups based on similarity.
